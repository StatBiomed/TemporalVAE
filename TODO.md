# TODO

**Try to keep all files <10MB each on this package!!!**

## Packaging
- [ ] reduce the verbose log info in the notebooks (e.g., hEmbryo8_Xiang_CV, 
  and hEmbryo8_training)

## Documentations
- [ ] may consider adding more formal documentations in the docs / readthedocs

## Examples
- [ ] simplify query notebook - currently the file is too big
- [ ] refine notebooks (e.g., reducing the long log info)

## Big changes
- [ ] Support much handy fit and predict functions, like UMAP.
