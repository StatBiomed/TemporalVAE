About TemporalVAE
------------
International efforts have yielded extensive single-cell time-series atlas datasets, like those on mouse embryogenesis, providing a reference for mapping disease models across biomedical research.
However, effectively using such data for temporal analysis of individual datasets is challenging
due to the intricate nature of cell states and the tight coupling between time stamps and experimental batches.
Here, we introduce TemporalVAE, a deep generative model in a dual-objective setting that infers the biological time of each cell from a compressed latent space, even in a zero-shot setting.
With a mouse development atlas, we demonstrated its scalability with millions of cells, accuracy in atlas-based cell staging across platforms,
and interpretability by identifying temporally sensitive genes with in silico perturbation.
TemporalVAE's effectiveness extends to cell staging during human peri-implantation in both  in vivo and  in vitro conditions,
as well as cross-primate comparisons among human, cynomolgus, and marmoset, signifying its potential for broad biomedical applications.
