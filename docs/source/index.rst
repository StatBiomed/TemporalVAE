**TemporalVAE** is a scalable toolkit for time-series single-cell transcriptomes analysis;
Time-series single-cell transcriptomes analysis enables cell staging predcition, temporally sensitive genes identification by in silico perturbation.


TemporalVAE's key applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- cell staging.
- cross-species prediction.
- temporal-sensitive gene identification.


Support
^^^^^^^
